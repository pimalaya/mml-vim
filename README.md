Vim plugin for email messages written in MML, base on [MML CLI](https://github.com/pimalaya/mml).

## Installation

First you need to install the [MML CLI](https://github.com/pimalaya/mml). Then you can install this plugin with your favorite plugin manager:

### Using [packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim)

```lua
use "https://github.com/pimalaya/mml-vim"
```

```vim
:PackerSync
```

### Using [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)

```vim
Plug 'https://github.com/pimalaya/mml-vim'
```

```vim
:PlugInstall
```

## Configuration

It is highly recommanded to have those Vim options on:

```vim
syntax on
filetype plugin on
set hidden
```

### `g:mml_executable`

Defines a custom path for the MML binary. Defaults to `mml`.

## Development

The development environment is managed by [Nix](https://nixos.org/download.html). Running `nix-shell` will spawn a shell with everything you need to get started with this plugin:

```sh
# start a nix shell
$ nix-shell

# start Vim with the testing message
$ vim ./test.mml

# start Neovim with the testing message
$ nvim ./test.mml
```
